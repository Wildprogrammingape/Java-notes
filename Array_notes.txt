1. guru : 大师，= master
Arrays come up very often in interview problems, and so being a guru with them is a must!

2.snippet 片段  = piece = extract
This Card is beginner friendly, and we've provided lots of code snippets in Java to help you understand.

3.subtle 微妙的 = delicate
These hints will be subtle enough to set you on a particular path for reaching the optimized solution, without giving away the answer too easily.

4.analogous 类似的 = akin=similar        analog 类比  
It's exactly the same with the Array, where the space in your home is analogous to memory on the computer.

5.primitive 原始的
The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them.

6.slot 插槽
Java always initializes empty Array slots to null if the Array contains objects, or to default values if it contains primitive types.
For example, the array int [] would contain the default value of 0 for each element, float[] would contain default values of 0.0, and bool[] would contain default values of false.

7.even number 偶数

8.vacant spot 空的点
If we want to delete the first element of the Array, that will create a vacant spot at the 0th index.

9.ripple 波纹
Going by the ripple effect, every element all the way to the last one will be shifted one place to the left.

10.cement 巩固= bond
To help you cement what you've learned, here's a couple of programming problems for you to try.
