In Java, every variable has a type declared in the source code. There are two kinds of types: reference types and primitive types. Reference types are references to objects. Primitive types directly contain values. There are 8 primitive types:

byte
short
int
long
char
float
double
boolean





e.g:

Primitive types in Java are none-class types. They only store values.

double d = 3.0;
d.intValue();  //compiler error!
Double d2 = new Double(3.0);
d2.intValue();  //works!

d is prilimitive type, while d2 is reference type
